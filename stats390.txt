-Statistics: discipline teaching us how to make informed decisions in cases with uncertainty
-Data: any info that is recorded
-Population: collection of all Data being recorded, every indivivual of interest in the study
	-note: the Population of a Sample is every object that could have been in the Sample
-Census: collection of Data from every member of a Population 
	(true Censuses are very rare, most are just Samples)
-Sample: a subset of a Population, for a good Sample randomness is key
	-Random sample: unbiased
	-Convenience smaple: biased
-Paramter: describes a characteristic of a Population, usually written as a Greek letter
-Statistic: describes a characteristic of a Sample, usually written as an X with a bar over(under? can't remember) it
-Descriptive: use Sample Data to describe the Population's characteristics, and is purely numerical
-Inferential: draws conclusions about a Population, often qualifying

-A Variable is a charecteristic whose value can change from one object to the next
-A Random Variable is determined by chance for each object
-Two kinds of data: Quantitative & Qualitative
	-Quantitative Data consists of numbers
	-Quantitative Data can be subdivided into Discrete or Continuous
		-Discrete Data is countable, Continuous is infinite in its scope
		-Discrete Data increases in finite amounts, meaning it has a smallest amount it can increment by
		-If it doesn't have a smallest amount, it's probably Continuous
	-Qualitative Data is categorical in nature

-Levels of Measurement tell us how much Data is in a Variable and what we can do with that Data
-The Levels of Measurement can be defined as such:
	-Nominal: Qualitative, unordered by nature
	-Ordinal: Qualitative, can be ordered, but the differences between values mean nothing
		-Differences between values aren't physical, i.e. not measurable
		-Examples include rating stars & level of higher education
	-Interval: can be ordered, the differences between values are meaningful, but there is no smallest value, i.e. no natural zero
		-An example is temperatue
	-Ratio: can be ordered, the differences between values are meaningful, & there is a natural zero where none of that quantity exists
		-An example is height
