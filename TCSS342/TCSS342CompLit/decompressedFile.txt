Smart thinking my boy! Let me see...That's some good sake! This is how we drank when we won our battles. 
The people of Ashina, together as one. Oh, the rebellion...we just took back what was stolen from us. 
Before, this land was...it was a place where we, the Ashina people lived. 
Where the waters flowed, straight from the source. We were a people who loved our country dearly. 
And we made good sake to boot! But we were heretics, and we were weak. Naturally, we were overrun. 
Trampled into submission. For many long, excruciating years...we couldn't even pray at the water from the springs. 
The way we were then...even good sake couldn't get us truly drunk. 
Yes...amidst the chaos that was Japan...the endless casualties. 
The flames of war...we found the perfect opportunity to take back our land. 
But now...it's a place of death...it's a bitter thing indeed.
